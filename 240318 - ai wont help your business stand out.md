AI won't help your business stand out



Here is the thing: ChatGPT is not smart. It knows what to say based on what other people have said before. It chooses the next words and phrases based on their probability of appearing after the last words. 

It is not in its DNA to be creative (yet). It is not even coded to be right. It is coded to make smart guesses based on past information. 

The most correct information tends to be the average - so ChatGPT will always give you the average. 

The algorithm can be fine-tuned to be more "creative." This means it can be told to stray a bit from the middle line, but it must stay between two limits for the sentences to make sense. 

For this reason, it is hard for ChatGPT (or any other AI) to write a copy that will make your business stand out. It is not in its DNA to stand out but to blend in. 



AI, what is it good for?

AI cannot develop original ideas but can help you better explain them. Feed it what you want to say, to whom, when, and all that jazz, and it will help you come up with the words your target audience uses. 

It can check your texts to make sure that it makes sense and it's well written.

It can help you bounce ideas and come up with better examplesâ€”examples the average member of your audience will understand. 

AI won't make your business stand out but your ideas will.
